# Comprehensive Loan Assessment System 

## Description
This project implements a dual-model Machine Learning system designed to evaluate loan applications. It tackles two main tasks simultaneously: predicting the probability of a loan being approved (Classification) and estimating the loan amount a customer is likely to request (Regression). 

## Objectives
* **Approval Probability:** Develop a classifier to determine the likelihood of loan approval based on a customer's financial background and credit score.
* **Amount Estimation:** Build a regression model to predict the requested loan amount.
* **Robust Preprocessing:** Utilize scikit-learn `Pipelines` and `ColumnTransformer` to ensure a clean, reproducible workflow and prevent data leakage, using a strict 80/20 sequential data split.

## Tools
* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-Learn:** Machine Learning library (RandomForestClassifier, Ridge Regression, Pipelines).
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
